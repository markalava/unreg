** UNlocations

*** Several tables in one

UNlocations is several tables in one. The different tables are identified by column ~location_type~. 

|-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~location_type~ | Description                                                                   |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               0 | Just contains a row for "World"                                               |
|               2 | Table of names and codes of "Major regions"                                   |
|               3 | Table of names and codes of "Subregions"                                      |
|               4 | Table of countries and mappings to major regions and subregions               |
|           other | All others are single-row tables listing the names and codes of other regions |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** Country-region mappings

Country-region mappings are stored in UNlocations in the ~location_type == 4~ table, but in two different ways:

1. Explicit column
2. Code-column name map 

**** Explicit column

M49 regions (therefore also SDG L2 regions) are stored simply as an extra column. Countries and regions are in the same row.

**** Code-column map

Other regions are encoded via the ~agcode_XXX~ columns. If ~x~ is the region code, then in each row, column ~agcode_z~ contains ~x~ if the country in column ~name~ is in region ~x~. ~z~ is ~x~ with enough 0s appended to make the numeric part of the column name 7 digits long.


* Notes

- It's not true that regions are partitions. For example, Canada does not have an M49 L2 region.

* Oddities

** "Other" regions added by UNPD

UNPD has added the following levels:

|--------+---------------|
| Family | Added Levels  |
|--------+---------------|
| SDG    | Europe        |
| WB     | Middle income |
|--------+---------------|

Europe is /not/ included in the list of SDG names and codes returned by ~internal_sdg_reg_L[1|2]_country_codes()~. However, it remains in ~unloc_df~ and is noticed by ~code()~, ~name()~, ~country_codes()~, and ~country_names()~. ~code()~ does recognize it as a duplicate.

Note that Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean are M49 and SDG names. 

**TODO** Likewise, Middle income, is /not/ included in the list of WB names and codes returned by ~internal_wb_reg_L1_country_codes()~. However, it remains in ~unloc_df~ and is noticed by ~code()~, ~name()~, ~country_codes()~, and ~country_names()~.

** Regions in multiple families

The following are in both the M49 and SDG families

- Northern America :: An M49 L1 region and an SDG L2 region with separate region codes.
- Latin America and the Caribbean :: An L2 region in the M49 and SDG families with separate region codes.
- Europe :: An M49 L1 region and an SDG "other" region with separate region codes.
